            <h1>TRS-80 Emulator</h1>

            <p>This is documentation for a web-based TRS-80 emulator. It is
            used in various websites, including
            <a href="https://www.my-trs-80.com/">My TRS-80</a>, the
            <a href="https://www.my-trs-80.com/cassette/">cassette decoder</a>, and the
            <a href="https://www.my-trs-80.com/ide/">IDE</a>.</p>

            <p>Hover the mouse pointer over the emulator to show a menu in the
            upper-left. The items in the menu depend on the specific site
            embedding the emulator, but can include resetting the machine,
            showing a configuration panel, taking a screenshot, toggling audio,
            rewinding the cassette, and editing the in-memory Basic
            program.</p>

            <p>There are two configuration panels. The one shown by clicking
            the gear icon lets you select the computer model, Basic level,
            character set, and amount of memory. The one shown by clicking
            the eye icon lets you select the phosphor color, background
            color, and whether simulated scanlines are shown.</p>

            <p>When emulating a Model III, use the <tt>Esc</tt> key to
            press <tt>Break</tt>, the <tt>\</tt> (backslash) key to
            press <tt>Clear</tt>, and <tt>Shift-Hyphen</tt> (underscore)
            to toggle uppercase/lowercase (what was <tt>Shift-0</tt>
            on the real machine).</p>

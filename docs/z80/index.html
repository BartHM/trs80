            <h1>Z80 Documentation</h1>

            <p>The Z80 has been thoroughly documented in books and websites,
            but there are a few things that I frequently need and don't
            find easily, so I'm putting them here.</p>

            <h2>Flags and Conditions</h2>

            <p>Some Z80 instructions can set flags to indicate something about
            the result of the operation. For example, when subtracting a value
            from the <tt>A</tt> register, the <tt>Z</tt> flag will be set if
            the resulting value is zero. The flags are stored in the <tt>F</tt>
            register. It is not normally accessed, but can be read by using
            the <tt>push af</tt> instruction.</p>

            <p>Load instructions and some 16-bit math instructions don't set
            the flag. Check the docs for the instruction.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b><tt>S</tt> (Sign):</b> Copy of the most
                    significant bit of the result. If the value is intended
                    to be interpreted as a signed value, then the <tt>S</tt>
                    flag indicates a negative value. (But don't confuse
                    with the <tt>N</tt> register below.)</li>

                <li><b><tt>Z</tt> (Zero):</b> Set if the entire result is zero.</li>

                <li><b><tt>H</tt> (Half carry):</b> Set if the right nibble overflows,
                    in other words, if there's a carry from bit 3 to bit 4. This
                    is only used by the <tt>DDA</tt> instruction that adjusts for
                    BCD arithmetic.</li>

                <li><b><tt>P/V</tt> (Parity or oVerflow):</b> Logical instructions
                    (<tt>AND</tt>, shifts, etc.) set
                    this to 1 if the result has an even number of bits set.
                    Arithmetic instructions (<tt>ADD</tt>, <tt>NEG</tt>, etc.)
                    set it if the 2's complement result does not fit in the register.
                    Overflow is different from carry in that the carry flag assumes
                    the operands are unsigned, whereas overflow assumes they're signed.
                    Put differently, overflow is set when both signed operands
                    are positive and signed sum is negative or both signed
                    operands are negative and the signed sum is positive.</li>

                <li><b><tt>N</tt> (Negative):</b> Set if the last instruction was
                    a subtraction. This is only used by the <tt>DAA</tt> instruction
                    that adjusts for BCD arithmetic. You probably don't need this,
                    don't confuse it with <tt>S</tt>.</li>

                <li><b><tt>C</tt> (Carry):</b> Set if the result does not fit in
                    the register. This assumes unsigned operands, and indicates
                    that the 8th bit carried into the 9th bit.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Yes, the flag that indicates a negative result should have been labeled
            <tt>N</tt> and that one that indicates a subtraction should have been
            labeled <tt>S</tt>, but it's the reverse of that.</p>

            <p>To <em>use</em> the flags, the most direct way is to jump only when
            a flag is set or reset. To jump if the result is zero:</p>

            <pre>jp z,foo</pre>

            <p>Of the six flags above, four can be used this way:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b><tt>z</tt></b>: Jump if the <tt>Z</tt> flag is set, i.e.,
                    the result is zero. Also useful to test the results of
                    the <tt>BIT</tt> instructions. Subroutines that return
                    a boolean often use the <tt>Z</tt> flag as well, perhaps
                    to indicate success or failure.</li>
                <li><b><tt>nz</tt></b>: Jump if the <tt>Z</tt> flag is reset, i.e.,
                    the result is non-zero.</li>
                <li><b><tt>c</tt></b>: Jump if the <tt>C</tt> flag is set, i.e.,
                    if there was a carry out of bit 8. The straightforward use is to see
                    if an addition overflowed, but many instruction use carries
                    as inputs or outputs, such as the shifts and rotates.</li>
                <li><b><tt>nc</tt></b>: Jump if the <tt>C</tt> flag is reset, i.e.,
                    there was no carry.</li>
                <li><b><tt>pe</tt></b>: Jump if the <tt>P</tt> flag is set, i.e.,
                    there was even parity out of logical instructions. Also used
                    to test the overflow flag.</li>
                <li><b><tt>po</tt></b>: Jump if the <tt>P</tt> flag is reset, i.e.,
                    there was odd parity out of logical instructions. Also used
                    to test the overflow flag.</li>
                <li><b><tt>m</tt></b>: Jump if the <tt>S</tt> flag is set, i.e.,
                    the result is negative (assuming it's a signed value).
                    Mnemonic is "minus".</li>
                <li><b><tt>p</tt></b>: Jump if the <tt>S</tt> flag is reset, i.e.,
                    the result is non-negative (assuming it's a signed value).
                    Mnemonic is "positive", though it also includes zero.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It can be tricky to think through how to use these. For example,
            after <tt>cp 5</tt>, how do you jump if <tt>A</tt> is less than 5?
            The value 5 is subtracted from <tt>A</tt>, so <tt>A &lt; 5</tt> is
            the same as <tt>A &minus; 5 &lt; 0</tt>, which means we can use the
            <tt>m</tt> test condition.</p>

            <p>Instructions <tt>JP</tt>, <tt>CALL</tt>, and
            <tt>RET</tt> all optionally take these conditions. The
            <tt>JR</tt> instruction only supports the <tt>z</tt>,
            <tt>nz</tt>, <tt>c</tt>, and <tt>nc</tt> conditions.</p>

            <p>There are other ways to use these flags. The <tt>ADC</tt> (add-with-carry)
            instruction will add the value of the carry flag to the result,
            for example. Several variants of the shift and rotate instructions
            will use the carry flag as the input bit.</p>

            <h2>Shifts and Rotates</h2>

            (this page does a good job of this, with diagrams: http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/z-80-g.htm)

            <p>Quick reference of the various shift and rotate instructions.
            The number 7 means existing bit 7, C means carry flag, and 0
            and 1 mean the bit values 0 and 1.</p>

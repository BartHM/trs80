            <h1>TRS-80 IDE Documentation</h1>

            <p>The
            <a href="https://www.my-trs-80.com/ide/">Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</a>
            documented here lets
            you write Z80 assembly language and see it running within a few milliseconds
            on a TRS-80 emulator.</p>

            <h2>Editor</h2>

            <p>The code is on the left, the emulator is on the right, and the
            pull-down menu is on top. As you type into the editor, the code is
            assembled on the fly. The machine language bytes are shown on the left
            next to each line. With every re-assembly, the TRS-80 emulator on the right
            is wiped clean, brought to a known state, and your program is loaded and
            run.</p>

            <p>Try this simple program:</p>

            <pre>        .org 0x8000

        ld hl,15360
        ld a,191
        ld (hl),a

stop:
        jp stop</pre>

            <p>The <tt>stop</tt> label must be in the first column, the rest
            must not be in the first column, and the indent is typically 8 spaces.
            It loads at 0x8000 (the start of the top 32K of RAM) and puts
            a graphic character block at the top-left of the screen. You should
            see this block appears as soon as you've finished typing the
            program. Try changing the character (<tt>191</tt>) to different values
            and watch the emulator update.</p>

            <h2>Assembler</h2>

            <p>The assembler attempts to handle the union of all past Z80 assembler
            syntaxes. For example, it handles both <tt>org</tt> and <tt>.org</tt>
            directives. For numeric literals in non-decimal bases, it handles
            C-style prefixes (<tt>0x3C00</tt>, <tt>0b10001010</tt>), assembler-style
            prefixes (<tt>$3C00</tt>, <tt>%10001010</tt>), and assembler-style
            suffixes (<tt>3C00h</tt>, <tt>10001010b</tt>).</p>

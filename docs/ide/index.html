            <h1>TRS-80 IDE Documentation</h1>

            <p>The
            <a href="https://www.my-trs-80.com/ide/">Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</a>
            documented here lets
            you write Z80 assembly language and see it running within a few milliseconds
            on a TRS-80 emulator.</p>

            <h2>Editor</h2>

            <p>The code is on the left, the emulator is on the right, and the
            pull-down menu is on top. As you type into the editor, the code is
            assembled on the fly. The machine language bytes are shown on the left
            next to each line. With every re-assembly, the TRS-80 emulator on the right
            is wiped clean, brought to a known state, and your program is loaded and
            run.</p>

            <p>Try this simple program:</p>

            <pre>        .org 0x8000

        ld hl,15360
        ld a,191
        ld (hl),a

stop:
        jp stop</pre>

            <p>The <tt>stop</tt> label must be in the first column, the rest
            must not be in the first column, and the indent is typically 8 spaces.
            It loads at 0x8000 (the start of the top 32K of RAM) and puts
            a graphic character block at the top-left of the screen. You should
            see this block appears as soon as you've finished typing the
            program. Try changing the character (<tt>191</tt>) to different values
            and watch the emulator update.</p>

            <h2>Screenshot Editor</h2>

            <p>In TRS-80 programs, screenshots such as splash screens and game
            mazes are often hard-coded into the assembly language code using
            a sequence of byte statements, like this:</p>

            <pre>        .byte 0x87,0x8B,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x83,0x83
        .byte 0x83,0x89,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C</pre>

            <p>These are tedious to write and edit. To simplify making
            these, the IDE provides a built-in paint program. Simply
            mark your bytes with these start and end comments:</p>

            <pre>        ; Screenshot
        .byte 0x87,0x8B,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x83,0x83
        .byte 0x83,0x89,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C,0x8C
        ; End screenshot</pre>

            <p>A <tt>EDIT</tt> button will appear to the right of the
            <tt>Screenshot</tt> comment. Click it to launch the paint
            program, which will replace the emulator's screen on the right.
            Click and drag in the screen to paint. Above the screen are various
            standard paint tools, most of which should be self-explanatory.
            Hover over each tool to see a hint about what it does.</p>

            <p>To save the painted screen back into the source code, click the
            check mark button. To cancel, click the circle-with-a-slash button
            to the right of it.</p>

            <p>The coordinates shown below the screen can be useful when
            constructing screens. Hold the <tt>Shift</tt> key while dragging
            out a new line, rectangle, or ellipse to get 45-degree lines,
            squares, or circles. The copy button not only copies the screen (or
            selected area) for later pasting within the paint program, but also
            copies an image of the area to your system clipboard for pasting
            into other applications.</p>

            <p>The program has infinite undo/redo, so don't be afraid to
            experiment!</p>

            <h2>Assembler</h2>

            <p>The assembler attempts to handle the union of all past Z80 assembler
            syntaxes. For example, it handles both <tt>org</tt> and <tt>.org</tt>
            directives. For numeric literals in non-decimal bases, it handles
            C-style prefixes (<tt>0x3C00</tt>, <tt>0b10001010</tt>), assembler-style
            prefixes (<tt>$3C00</tt>, <tt>%10001010</tt>), and assembler-style
            suffixes (<tt>3C00h</tt>, <tt>10001010b</tt>).</p>

(Internal notes for developers.)

To add a dependency:

    npm -w packages/OUR_PACKAGE_NAME install --save THEIR_PACKAGE_NAME

No need to add dependencies between our own modules, they're all available
to each other.

To publish new version:

- In "my-trs-80" directory:
    % npm run publish
- In "trs80-cassette-webapp" directory:
    % npm run publish
- In "trs80-tool" directory:
    Edit package.json and bump version.
    Update site/index.html
    % npm run buildBinaries
    % make rsync rsync-site
    % git commit -am "trs80-tool: Step to X.Y.Z."
    % git tag vX.Y.Z

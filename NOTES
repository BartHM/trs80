(Internal notes for developers.)

To add a dependency:

    npm -w packages/OUR_PACKAGE_NAME install --save THEIR_PACKAGE_NAME

No need to add dependencies between our own modules, they're all available
to each other.

To publish new version:

- Update and commit README.md and trs80-tool/site/index.html.
- Run "lerna publish patch" (or "minor") in top-level directory.
- Check in new "version.ts" file.
- In "trs80-tool" directory:
    % npm run buildBinaries
    % make rsync rsync-site
- In "my-trs-80" directory:
    % npm run publish
- In "trs80-cassette-webapp" directory:
    % npm run publish
